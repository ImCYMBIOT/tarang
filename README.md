# Tarang
Tarang is a Recommendation engine. 
We have used collaborative filtering as the base model for this project, since its a work in progress, all and any technology is subject to change.
The expected features of this engine are -
* Time based recommendations
* Recommendation based on taste profile
* Random Recommendations opposite to taste profile

We are implementing this engine for recommending songs for now, but we are hopeful to expand it to a True and Complete Reccomendation Engine.
